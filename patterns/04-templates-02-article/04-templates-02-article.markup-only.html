          Hey, someone left a job brochure here. Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart! Noooooooooooo! Which indicator is that? I&#39;m not sure I see anything there. (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... Edgeworth was pulled
          into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.)

          Wonderful. Today&#39;s special must be Fillet O&#39; Phoenix! No no no! You&#39;ve got it all wrong! Great, just stomp on my dreams, why don&#39;t you. (What&#39;s with her? All she&#39;s said for the last few minutes is utter nonsense!) Have you ever
          thought, all those spikes protect it&#39;s top but what about underneath it? (When presenting incorrect evidence) Hey guess what? Actually, I really hate your guts. So get lost because, well I&#39;m not co-operating.

          I don&#39;t think Daddy was ever rich, even when he was in law. (Well excuuuse me, Princess. ...Anyway, should I ask to hear the story again...?) (Mia&#39;s really got this guy eating out of her hands…)

          Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand. Oh, Trucy&#39;s still a child. Here&#39;s what I want you to do, Trucy. Take that memory, gently lock it away deep in your heart, and never speak of it. (when seeing the Psyche-Locks
          for the first time) (W-WHAT IN THE WORLD?!) B-But why…!? Why would you do such a thing? (Huh? It wasn&#39;t Dahlia…?)
